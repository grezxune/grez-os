## Daily Brief Archive (External)

Daily briefs are generated in the external storage root so they remain private by default.

- Ensure `GREZOS_STORAGE_PATH` is set (or rely on the `~/Documents/grez-os` default).
- Generated briefs appear under `${GREZOS_STORAGE_PATH}/daily-brief`.
- Keep this repo directory as documentation only; do not commit personal brief files.
