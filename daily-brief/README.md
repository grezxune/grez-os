## Daily Brief Archive (External)

Daily briefs are written to the external storage root so they stay private by default.

- Ensure `GREZOS_STORAGE_PATH` is set (or rely on the `~/Documents/grez-os` default).
- Generated briefs appear under `${GREZOS_STORAGE_PATH}/daily-brief`.
- Keep this repo directory for documentation; avoid committing personal briefing files.
