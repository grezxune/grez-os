## Data Storage

Structured data (Convex exports, JSON summaries, analytics) is stored outside the repository.

- Configure `GREZOS_STORAGE_PATH` (defaults to `~/Documents/grez-os`).
- Keep data assets at `${GREZOS_STORAGE_PATH}/data`.
- Avoid committing raw data to the repo; provide sanitized examples as needed.
