## Goals Library

Goal documents live in the external storage root so each user can maintain private targets.

- Set `GREZOS_STORAGE_PATH` (default `~/Documents/grez-os`).
- Store current goal files under `${GREZOS_STORAGE_PATH}/goals`.
- Publish sanitized or template goals in this directory when sharing publicly.
