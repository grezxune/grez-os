## External Journal Storage

Daily journal entries are stored outside the repository.

- Configure `GREZOS_STORAGE_PATH` (default `~/Documents/grez-os`) to locate your personal data root.
- Maintain journal files under `${GREZOS_STORAGE_PATH}/journal`.
- Keep sensitive reflections out of version control by design.
