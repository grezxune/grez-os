## Metrics Storage

Weekly reports, historical dashboards, and roadmaps live in the external storage root.

- Configure `GREZOS_STORAGE_PATH` (default `~/Documents/grez-os`).
- Keep metrics artifacts in `${GREZOS_STORAGE_PATH}/metrics`.
- Copy sanitized summaries into the repo when sharing publicly.
