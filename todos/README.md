## Legacy Todos

Active planning is handled via PRDs in the external storage root.

- Maintain any remaining todo notes at `${GREZOS_STORAGE_PATH}/todos` (default storage root `~/Documents/grez-os`).
- Consider migrating outstanding todos into PRDs and keeping this directory empty in the shared repo.
